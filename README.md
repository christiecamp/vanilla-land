# M2 CHALLENGE - Creating a Portfolio

## User Story

**AS An** employer

**I WANT** to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

**WHEN** I load their portfolio

**THEN** I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

**WHEN** I click one of the links in the navigation

**THEN** the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

**WHEN** I click on the link to the section about their work

**THEN** the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

**WHEN** I am presented with the developer's first application

**THEN** that application's image should be larger in size than the others

**WHEN** I click on the images of the applications

**THEN** I am taken to that deployed application

**WHEN** I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

**THEN** I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## IMPORTANT NOTE

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

**!!** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.
